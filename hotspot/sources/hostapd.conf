# Interface for separate control program. If this is specified, hostapd
# will create this directory and a UNIX domain socket for listening to requests
# from external programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status information and
# configuration. The socket file will be named based on the interface name, so
# multiple hostapd processes/interfaces can be run at the same time if more
# than one interface is used.
# /var/run/hostapd is the recommended directory for sockets and by default,
# hostapd_cli will use it when trying to connect with hostapd.
ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd

# Access control for the control interface can be configured by setting the
# directory to allow only members of a group to use sockets. This way, it is
# possible to run hostapd as root (since it needs to change network
# configuration and open raw sockets) and still allow GUI/CLI components to be
# run as non-root users. However, since the control interface can be used to
# change the network configuration, this access needs to be protected in many
# cases. By default, hostapd is configured to use gid 0 (root). If you
# want to allow non-root users to use the contron interface, add a new group
# and change this value to match with that group. Add users that should have
# control interface access to this group.
#
# This variable can be a group name or gid.

##### IEEE 802.11 related configuration #######################################

#ssid2=P"hello\nthere"

# Country code (ISO/IEC 3166-1). Used to set regulatory domain.
# Set as needed to indicate country in which device is operating.
# This can limit available channels and transmit power.

# Operation mode (a = IEEE 802.11a, b = IEEE 802.11b, g = IEEE 802.11g,
# ad = IEEE 802.11ad (60 GHz); a/g options are used with IEEE 802.11n, too, to
# specify band)
# Default: IEEE 802.11b

# Channel number (IEEE 802.11)
# (default: 0, i.e., not set)
# Please note that some drivers do not use this value from hostapd and the
# channel will need to be configured separately with iwconfig.
#
# If CONFIG_ACS build option is enabled, the channel can be selected
# automatically at run time by setting channel=acs_survey or channel=0, both of
# which will enable the ACS survey based algorithm.

# Station MAC address -based authentication
# Please note that this kind of access control requires a driver that uses
# hostapd to take care of management frame processing and as such, this can be
# used with driver=hostap or driver=nl80211, but not with driver=atheros.

# configured to allow both of these or only one. Open system authentication

# bit 1 = Shared Key Authentication (requires WEP)

##### WPA/IEEE 802.11i configuration ##########################################
# Enable WPA. Setting this variable configures the AP to require WPA (either
# WPA-PSK or WPA-RADIUS/EAP based on other configuration). For WPA-PSK, either
# wpa_psk or wpa_passphrase must be set and wpa_key_mgmt must include WPA-PSK.
# Instead of wpa_psk / wpa_passphrase, wpa_psk_radius might suffice.
# For WPA-RADIUS/EAP, ieee8021x must be set (but without dynamic WEP keys),
# RADIUS authentication server must be configured, and WPA-EAP must be included
# in wpa_key_mgmt.
# This field is a bit field that can be used to enable WPA (IEEE 802.11i/D3.0)
# and/or WPA2 (full IEEE 802.11i/RSN):
# bit0 = WPA
# bit1 = IEEE 802.11i/RSN (WPA2) (dot11RSNAEnabled)
wpa=2

# WPA pre-shared keys for WPA-PSK. This can be either entered as a 256-bit
# secret in hex format (64 hex digits), wpa_psk, or as an ASCII passphrase
# (8..63 characters) that will be converted to PSK. This conversion uses SSID
# so the PSK changes when ASCII passphrase is used and the SSID is changed.
# wpa_psk (dot11RSNAConfigPSKValue)

# Set of accepted key management algorithms (WPA-PSK, WPA-EAP, or both). The
# entries are separated with a space. WPA-PSK-SHA256 and WPA-EAP-SHA256 can be

# Set of accepted cipher suites (encryption algorithms) for pairwise keys
# (unicast packets). This is a space separated list of algorithms:
# CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC [RFC 3610, IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol [IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# Group cipher suite (encryption algorithm for broadcast and multicast frames)
# is automatically selected based on this configuration. If only CCMP is
# allowed as the pairwise cipher, group cipher will also be CCMP. Otherwise,
# TKIP will be used as the group cipher.
